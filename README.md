# iOS challenge

## What to expect
We would like to learn more about how you approach a challenge as an iOS Engineer.
There is a simple app that displays customer reviews for one of our most popular activities. 
The challenge will be composed of a pair programming session, where we are going to add a missing feature.

We’ll evaluate platform, problem solving, and testing knowledge.

What you’ll need:
- Xcode and its command line tools installed
